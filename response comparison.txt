I need to compare my models with RAG enabled and measure which response is better.  
I am looking to get responses that are good for academic research and paper writing.  
I am basically building a RAG system that can take in a lot of documents and produce college level papers and work based on those docements so I can use that in my own research and learning.

Here is the question:
What challenges did Robertâ€™s Rangers face during their missions? Give me a detailed long response in essay format.



This is the response from my base model with my RAG operating on llama3.1 70B RAG version 1.2::
Robert's Rangers, led by Major Robert Rogers, faced numerous challenges during their missions in the French and Indian War. The rangers were an elite group of colonial soldiers who specialized in unconventional warfare, conducting reconnaissance, raids, and skirmishes against the French and their Native American allies. Despite their expertise and bravery, they encountered several obstacles that tested their skills and resolve.

One of the primary challenges the rangers faced was the harsh environment of the northeastern frontier. The rugged terrain, dense forests, and unpredictable weather conditions made it difficult for them to navigate and communicate effectively. The rangers had to be skilled in wilderness survival, able to endure extreme temperatures, and adapt to unexpected situations. For instance, during their expedition to Lake Champlain in 1759, they encountered severe snowstorms that slowed their progress and forced them to take shelter.

Another challenge the rangers faced was the cunning and resourcefulness of their French and Native American enemies. The French had a strong presence in the region, with well-fortified outposts and alliances with various Native American tribes. The rangers had to be constantly on guard against ambushes, raids, and sabotage. They also had to contend with the clever tactics employed by their enemies, such as fake retreats and decoy parties. During the Battle on Snowshoes in 1758, the rangers were ambushed by a combined force of French and Native American warriors, who used their knowledge of the terrain to launch a surprise attack.

Furthermore, the rangers faced internal challenges, including logistical difficulties and personnel issues. They often had to operate with limited supplies and equipment, which made it difficult for them to sustain themselves on long missions. For example, during their expedition to Ticonderoga in 1759, they ran low on food and ammunition, forcing them to rely on foraging and improvisation. Additionally, the rangers sometimes struggled with discipline and morale, particularly when faced with prolonged periods of hardship or uncertainty.

Despite these challenges, Robert's Rangers demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. They developed innovative tactics, such as using snowshoes to move stealthily through the forest and employing Native American scouts to gather intelligence. The rangers also learned to rely on each other, developing strong bonds of trust and camaraderie that helped them overcome adversity.

In conclusion, Robert's Rangers faced a range of challenges during their missions in the French and Indian War. From navigating the unforgiving environment of the northeastern frontier to countering the cunning tactics of their enemies, they demonstrated remarkable bravery, resourcefulness, and adaptability. Despite internal difficulties and external obstacles, the rangers remained a formidable force, playing a crucial role in the British war effort and cementing their place in American military history.

Robert's Rangers, led by Major Robert Rogers, played a crucial role in the French and Indian War as an elite group of soldiers skilled in wilderness warfare. Throughout their missions, they faced numerous challenges that tested their physical and mental endurance. The rangers' experiences during this period provide valuable insights into the difficulties they encountered while operating in the unforgiving wilderness.

One of the primary challenges Robert's Rangers confronted was navigating the dense and uncharted terrain of the American wilderness. The rangers were often required to traverse vast distances on foot, carrying heavy packs and supplies, through treacherous terrain that included mountains, forests, and swamps (Rogers, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 120). This necessitated a high level of physical fitness and endurance, as well as expertise in wilderness survival skills such as hunting, foraging, and shelter construction. The rangers' ability to navigate this challenging terrain was crucial to their success, as it allowed them to move undetected through enemy territory and launch surprise attacks.

Another significant challenge faced by Robert's Rangers was the harsh weather conditions they encountered during their missions. The rangers operated in extreme temperatures, from the scorching heat of summer to the bitter cold of winter (Ross, War on the Run, 236). This required them to be adaptable and resourceful, using their knowledge of wilderness survival skills to protect themselves from the elements. For example, they would often build shelters using natural materials such as branches and leaves to shield themselves from wind, rain, and snow.

Additionally, Robert's Rangers faced the ever-present threat of enemy attack. They were constantly on guard against French and Native American forces, who were determined to repel them from their territory (Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 451). The rangers developed a range of tactics to counter this threat, including ambushes, skirmishes, and surprise attacks. These tactics required a high level of discipline and training, as well as an ability to think on one's feet in the heat of battle.

Furthermore, Robert's Rangers experienced significant logistical challenges during their missions. The rangers often had to operate for extended periods without resupply, relying on their own resources and ingenuity to sustain themselves (Loescher, The History of Rogers' Rangers, 4:1-2). This necessitated a high level of self-sufficiency, as well as an ability to improvise and adapt in the face of adversity. For example, they would often hunt and forage for food, using their knowledge of wilderness survival skills to supplement their meager rations.

The rangers also faced significant psychological challenges during their missions. The constant threat of attack, combined with the physical hardships of wilderness warfare, took a heavy toll on their mental health (Brumwell, White Devil, 146-49). The rangers had to develop coping mechanisms to deal with the stress and anxiety of their situation, including techniques such as meditation and teamwork.

Finally, Robert's Rangers faced significant leadership challenges during their missions. Major Rogers was an experienced and skilled leader, but he still faced difficulties in maintaining discipline and morale among his men (Rogers, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 117). The rangers were often required to operate independently, making decisions on the fly without direct supervision. This necessitated a high level of trust and confidence between the rangers, as well as an ability to think critically and make sound judgments in the heat of battle.

In conclusion, Robert's Rangers faced numerous challenges during their missions in the French and Indian War. These challenges included navigating treacherous terrain, coping with harsh weather conditions, countering enemy attacks, overcoming logistical difficulties, managing psychological strain, and maintaining effective leadership. The rangers' ability to overcome these challenges was a testament to their skill, endurance, and adaptability, and played a crucial role in the ultimate success of their missions.
