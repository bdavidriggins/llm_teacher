I need to compare my models with RAG enabled and measure which response is better.  
I am looking to get responses that are good for academic research and paper writing.  
I am basically building a RAG system that can take in a lot of documents and produce college level papers and work based on those docements so I can use that in my own research and learning.

Here is the question:
What challenges did Robertâ€™s Rangers face during their missions? Give me a detailed long response in essay format.



This is the response from my base model with my RAG operating on llama3.1 70B RAG version 1.2::
Robert's Rangers, led by Major Robert Rogers, faced numerous challenges during their missions in the French and Indian War. The rangers were an elite group of colonial soldiers who specialized in unconventional warfare, conducting reconnaissance, raids, and skirmishes against the French and their Native American allies. Despite their expertise and bravery, they encountered several obstacles that tested their skills and resolve.

One of the primary challenges the rangers faced was the harsh environment of the northeastern frontier. The rugged terrain, dense forests, and unpredictable weather conditions made it difficult for them to navigate and communicate effectively. The rangers had to be skilled in wilderness survival, able to endure extreme temperatures, and adapt to unexpected situations. For instance, during their expedition to Lake Champlain in 1759, they encountered severe snowstorms that slowed their progress and forced them to take shelter.

Another challenge the rangers faced was the cunning and resourcefulness of their French and Native American enemies. The French had a strong presence in the region, with well-fortified outposts and alliances with various Native American tribes. The rangers had to be constantly on guard against ambushes, raids, and sabotage. They also had to contend with the clever tactics employed by their enemies, such as fake retreats and decoy parties. During the Battle on Snowshoes in 1758, the rangers were ambushed by a combined force of French and Native American warriors, who used their knowledge of the terrain to launch a surprise attack.

Furthermore, the rangers faced internal challenges, including logistical difficulties and personnel issues. They often had to operate with limited supplies and equipment, which made it difficult for them to sustain themselves on long missions. For example, during their expedition to Ticonderoga in 1759, they ran low on food and ammunition, forcing them to rely on foraging and improvisation. Additionally, the rangers sometimes struggled with discipline and morale, particularly when faced with prolonged periods of hardship or uncertainty.

Despite these challenges, Robert's Rangers demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. They developed innovative tactics, such as using snowshoes to move stealthily through the forest and employing Native American scouts to gather intelligence. The rangers also learned to rely on each other, developing strong bonds of trust and camaraderie that helped them overcome adversity.

In conclusion, Robert's Rangers faced a range of challenges during their missions in the French and Indian War. From navigating the unforgiving environment of the northeastern frontier to countering the cunning tactics of their enemies, they demonstrated remarkable bravery, resourcefulness, and adaptability. Despite internal difficulties and external obstacles, the rangers remained a formidable force, playing a crucial role in the British war effort and cementing their place in American military history.

Answer: Robert Rogers' Rangers faced numerous challenges during their missions, which were instrumental in shaping the course of the French and Indian War. As an elite force, they were tasked with conducting reconnaissance, gathering intelligence, and carrying out raids behind enemy lines. The Rangers' experiences, as documented by Robert Rogers himself, provide a glimpse into the difficulties they encountered.

One of the primary challenges faced by the Rangers was navigating the treacherous terrain of the northern frontier. The dense forests, rugged mountains, and swampy wetlands made it difficult for them to move undetected and quickly respond to enemy movements. This environment also took a toll on their physical health, with many men succumbing to disease, hunger, and exhaustion.

Another significant challenge was the harsh weather conditions they encountered. The Rangers often had to endure extreme temperatures, from scorching heat to freezing cold, which made it difficult for them to maintain their equipment and stay healthy. For instance, during one mission, Rogers noted that his men were met with "a most violent storm of rain" (Hough, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 27), which hindered their progress and made it challenging to keep their powder dry.

The Rangers also faced challenges related to logistics and supply. They often had to rely on irregular supplies, which sometimes left them without essential provisions like food and ammunition. During one mission, Rogers noted that his men were forced to " subsist on green corn" (Rogers, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 23) due to a lack of proper rations. This scarcity of resources made it difficult for them to sustain long-term operations.

Moreover, the Rangers faced significant enemy opposition, which posed a constant threat to their safety and success. They were frequently attacked by French and Native American forces, who employed guerrilla warfare tactics like ambushes and skirmishes. During one engagement, Rogers' men were met with "a most violent fire" (Hough, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 45) from an enemy force that outnumbered them. The Rangers had to rely on their training, discipline, and bravery to overcome these challenges.

Additionally, the Rangers often struggled with maintaining cohesion and unity within their ranks. As a diverse group composed of colonists, Native Americans, and European soldiers, they faced cultural and linguistic barriers that made communication and coordination challenging. Rogers himself noted instances where his men were disordered or separated during battles (Hough, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 45), which compromised their effectiveness.

Lastly, the Rangers had to contend with the psychological toll of war. The constant exposure to violence, death, and uncertainty took a significant mental health toll on the men. Rogers noted instances where his men were "considerably disordered" (Hough, Journals of Robert Rogers of the Rangers, 45) after engaging in intense combat, which highlights the psychological strain they endured.

In conclusion, Robert Rogers' Rangers faced numerous challenges during their missions, including treacherous terrain, harsh weather conditions, logistical difficulties, enemy opposition, internal cohesion issues, and psychological trauma. Despite these obstacles, they persevered and played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the French and Indian War. Their experiences serve as a testament to the bravery, resilience, and determination of the Rangers, who have become an enduring symbol of American military history.
