On the western shore of Lake George, a few miles from the fortress of Ticonderoga, is a mountain known by tradition as Rogers Rock. It is visited by many sightseers each year. The swift descent down the mountain face to the frozen lake below by a celebrated ranger in the English service, after a desperate and unfortunate engagement, has kept alive in popular memory an obstinate fight maintained by him and his followers against a superior foe. Yet, this was merely one of the many adventures through which Robert Rogers gained distinction during the French and Indian War, and it is just one of the events that has imbued the landscape of Lake George with deep human significance.

Robert Rogers lived to see his brilliant reputation dimmed by failures and errors. His prestige in England as a scout and fighter won him, in 1766, the appointment of commandant at Michilimackinac, far beyond the verge of civilization in the Northwest. This success was facilitated by the publication of his *Journals*, in which he relates the experiences and exploits that form the foundation of his reputation. General Gage, in his instructions to Rogers, enjoined upon him "the strictest economy" in the small expenses he might need to incur at the post, and further placed him under the superintendency of Sir William Johnson in any transactions he might have with the Indians.

At Michilimackinac, Rogers' independent dealings with the Indians, his extravagant use of public funds, and the licenses he granted to traders—against trade regulations—soon revealed a grandiose plan that alarmed both Gage and Johnson. By his own admission in the elaborate "Plan" he prepared for his defense with the imperial government, he sought to create a civil establishment under a Governor at that post. While this design was, in itself, innocent if premature, the manner in which he pursued it—against the authority placed over him—made him enemies and brought about charges of treason. Rogers' statements to a resident at the post, and his correspondence with an officer in the French service, led to his withdrawal and a subsequent trial for treason at Montreal.

An article of interest by M. M. Quaife, on the career of Robert Rogers, appeared recently in the Burton Historical Leaflets series. It reviews the Michilimackinac episode and provides the following comment on Rogers’ failure:

> "It was his misfortune and that of his country that he lacked the capacity to realize the vision he conceived of establishing peace and prosperity in the western wilderness. Compared with the cynical selfishness of Sir William Johnson's attitude toward the natives, Rogers' policy seems refreshingly humane and progressive."

It is difficult to compare the steady, systematic course of a responsible government officer like Johnson with the undertakings of an adventurous figure like Rogers, who, entrusted with specific duties, cast off authority and followed only his own ambitions. However, it seems clear that Sir William Johnson had few rivals in his dedication to the rights and welfare of the Indians. His fame among the tribes as a wise and good friend rested on thirty years of laborious service. Johnson occupied a position of great difficulty, requiring a broad understanding of the relationship between the colonies and the Indian nations, and few figures in American history can match his skillful and just handling of these responsibilities.

During the Revolutionary War, after a period of apparent indecision, Rogers chose the side opposing popular liberty. He failed to maintain the reputation of his earlier years and became a source of continual dissatisfaction to his superiors in the King’s service, due to irregularities and inefficiency. Ample proof of this is found in the Canadian Archives for 1889.

In May 1779, Rogers was authorized as lieutenant colonel to raise two battalions of rangers. By February 10, 1780, he was still recruiting in Quebec, to the frustration of General Haldimand, who believed Rogers was "losing time." By March 7, Rogers had made little progress, and Haldimand expressed astonishment that he was still in town. This was not the Rogers of the Lake George campaigns; no one could have accused him of loitering in military service then. In April, Rogers’ brother, Major James Rogers, communicated to headquarters that instead of raising 700 men, Robert had contracted debts and drawn bills on Quebec without advancing the service. James Rogers expressed concern that Robert had become the prey of intemperance.

Later that year, James reported that Robert was sending detachments to the Green Mountains and the counties in disaffected parts of New York. However, nothing in Rogers' expenditures at that time recalled the magnificent designs he pursued in 1766 and 1767 at his post in the Northwest. It was to the advantage of the American cause that Robert Rogers' talents were in decline during the Revolutionary War.

When the historian reviews Robert Rogers' life, the traveler still has something to ponder while gazing at the waters of Lake George. The struggle over empire may enter his thoughts as a boat or canoe traces its way over the lake, or as he climbs the mountains near Ticonderoga. He may hear the sounds of conflict, where brave men fell, with Rogers directing the fight using his consummate forest strategy.
