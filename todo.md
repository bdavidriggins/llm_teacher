## TODO


The last code built for testing was main.py and it does all the data prep.
rag_pipeline.py is the code that codes the RAG model.

There is an issue with the VM/Nvidia/GPUs/Docker.  When I restart the VM it will only start using the GPU if I reboot the docker 
sudo systemctl restart docker
I archived the GPT chat on the issue. 






To make your RAG system more competitive with a model like GPT-4, consider the following optimizations:

#### 1. **Improved Document Embedding and Retrieval:**

   - **Clustering**: If you have thousands of pages of data, clustering similar documents into topics could improve retrieval performance. You can use the clusters as an additional layer of filtering to surface more relevant documents.
   - **Contextual retrieval**: Instead of retrieving standalone documents, train a model to predict relevance given both the query and the document context. This might involve using a Cross-Encoder for reranking, as you already do in the `RAGSystem`.

#### 2. **Better Chunking and Contextual Combination:**
   - **Dynamic chunk size**: Increase the chunk size, or use dynamic chunking based on content boundaries such as paragraphs, sentences, or even sections of documents. Too small chunks can limit context understanding, while too large chunks can make retrieval less precise.
   - **Combining retrieved documents**: After retrieval, concatenate more documents or intelligently select relevant sections from each document to provide a larger context. This can help bridge the gap in providing enough information for complex questions.

#### 3. **Enhanced Reranking:**
   - **Use more advanced reranking models**: Cross-Encoders such as `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` are great, but more advanced models (like `cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6`) may provide better accuracy. You can try using more powerful Cross-Encoders that take both the query and documents into account and rerank them based on similarity in a more contextual way.
   - **Fine-tune your reranker**: If possible, fine-tune the reranker on domain-specific queries and answers to make it more specialized in your specific field of data.

#### 4. **Improved Response Generation:**
   - **Use a better language model**: Your current setup uses LLaMA 3.1, which, while good, might not be as advanced as GPT-4. Consider upgrading to a more powerful model like LLaMA 2 70B or an even larger model if feasible on your infrastructure.
   - **Fine-tuning the generator**: If possible, fine-tune your generation model on specific data relevant to your use case. You can fine-tune models like LLaMA 2 or even custom GPT models to better respond in the domain you’re working on.
   - **Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: While you’re already using a RAG system, ensure that your generation model is using the full context retrieved effectively. You can fine-tune the system to better integrate and reference the retrieved documents.

#### 5. **Hybrid Search (Neural + Symbolic)**:
   - Combine traditional keyword-based search (like BM25) with neural search (FAISS + embeddings). This can be particularly useful for cases where your neural embeddings may not capture certain specifics that keyword-based methods would (e.g., very specific facts, dates, names).

#### 6. **Increase Model Context Window**:
   - **Larger Context Window**: Some models, like GPT-4-turbo, have larger context windows that can take in more context during a single pass. If your model has a smaller context window (e.g., 2,048 tokens), consider using models with larger windows (such as models fine-tuned for long-context use cases).
   - **Long-context transformers**: Use models like Longformer or BigBird that can handle long contexts without the quadratic cost of regular transformers. This allows you to pass much more data into the model at once.

#### 7. **Semantic Search and Better QA Techniques**:
   - **Train a better QA model**: Instead of simply relying on the RAG setup, consider using a specialized question-answering (QA) model. You can train or fine-tune a QA model to give better answers based on the retrieved documents.
   - **Context-aware QA**: Use systems that actively reason about the retrieved information. For example, instead of concatenating the results, try answering queries in multiple steps and iterating on answers with follow-up queries.

#### 8. **Consider Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**:
   - In cases where absolute precision is necessary, consider integrating human feedback loops into the system. This can help correct or guide the model when it makes errors or retrieves irrelevant content.

### Summary:
Your custom RAG system has a lot of potential, but GPT-4 benefits from massive pre-training, better handling of context, and advanced optimization methods. To make your RAG system more competitive:

1. **Upgrade to better embedding and reranking models**.
2. **Increase context size** by tweaking chunking and retrieval mechanisms.
3. **Improve the generation model** by using larger or fine-tuned models.
4. **Enhance retrieval methods** with hybrid search and semantic understanding.
5. **Use QA systems** to better handle retrieved data and provide more intelligent answers.

By implementing these enhancements, your RAG system will better handle thousands of pages of data and provide smarter, more contextually rich responses.
